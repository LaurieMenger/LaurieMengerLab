# Site design

This website is hosted on [Github.io](github.io) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The website is based on a fantastic [template](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab) provided by Milan Allan and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). All pages are written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for easy editing, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) uses Liquid for the data-driven pages.  

Lists of publications are generated in realtime upon page loading using a great [script](http://www.alexhadik.com/blog/2014/6/12/create-pubmed-citations-automatically-using-pubmed-api) by Alex Hadik.
