### Immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have a powerful ability to drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also promote deleterious autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, collectively referred to as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive inflammation.  

While immunoregulatory mechanisms play a beneficial role in preventing inflammation, they can also suppress immune responses against cancer in a process known as immunosuppression. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as 'brakes' on immune activation and have important consequences in **inflammation** and **cancer**.  

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning host immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression. This will enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer.

To this end, we utilise cutting-edge molecular and cellular immunology, functional genomics, and mouse genetics and cancer models, and to enable the discovery and characterisation of novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms (see [Research](research)).

We are located at the Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge and work closely with collaborators within both the University and broader Cambridge immunology communities, including the Okkenhaug, Liston, Trynka, Halim and Linterman laboratories. Our science benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge.

 **We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master's students [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies)!**
