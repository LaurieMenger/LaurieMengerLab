## Welcome to the Roychoudhuri Lab
### Immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression

T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive T cell activation. In cancer, immunoregulatory mechanisms can be co-opted by tumours to drive deleterious immunosuppression. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as 'brakes' on immune activation and have important consequences in **inflammation** and **cancer**.  

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning host immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression. This will enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer.

We utilise cutting-edge approaches in molecular and cellular immunology, functional genomics and mouse genetics to uncover and characterise novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms (see [Research](research)).

We are located at the Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge and work closely with collaborators within both the University and broader Cambridge immunology communities, including the Okkenhaug, Liston, Trynka, Halim and Linterman laboratories. Our science benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge.

 **We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master's students [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies)!**
