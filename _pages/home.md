<h3 style="margin-top:16px">Immune regulation in inflammation and cancer</h3>

T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive T cell activation that would otherwise cause deleterious inflammation, or immunopathology following infection. Immunoregulatory mechanisms also suppress beneficial anti-tumour T cell responses to drive deleterious immunosuppression in cancer. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ on immune activation and have important consequences in **infection, inflammation** and **cancer**.

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning immunoregulation and cancer immunosuppression. Fundamental discovery in the field of immunoregulation will pave the way for new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer.

Our lab utilises cutting-edge molecular immunology, functional genomics and mouse genetics to enable discovery and characterisation of novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms (see [Research](research)). We are particularly interested in immunoregulatory mechanisms that control the differentiation and function of CD4+ and CD8+ conventional T cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. The lab, led by [Dr Rahul Roychoudhuri]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/member/rahul), is located at the Babraham Institute and the Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge and works closely with collaborators within both the University and broader Cambridge immunology community. Our science benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge and the Babraham Institute.

 **We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master's students [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies)!**
