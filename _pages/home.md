<h3 style="margin-top:0px">Immune Regulation in Inflammation and Cancer</h3> 
**T cells** drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as **immunoregulatory mechanisms**, to restrain excessive T cell activation and prevent autoimmune and allergic inflammation. It is now known that such suppressive mechanisms inhibit anti-tumour immunity to drive deleterious **immunosuppression** in cancer. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ within the immune system and have important consequences in **inflammation and cancer**. 

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression. Fundamental discovery in the field of immunoregulation will pave the way for new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer (see [Research](research)).

[Rahul Roychoudhuri]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/member/rahul) is Professor of Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy at the University of Cambridge. The laboratory is located at the Department of Pathology and forms part of the CRUK Cambridge Centre. The laboratory works closely with collaborators within the Cambridge Immunology community and both nationally and internationally. Our work benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge.
