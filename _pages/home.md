## Welcome to the Roychoudhuri Lab

### Immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression

T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive T cell activation. Immunoregulatory mechanisms also suppress beneficial anti-tumour T cell responses to drive deleterious immunosuppression in cancer. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ on immune activation and have important consequences in **inflammation** and **cancer**.

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning immunoregulation and cancer immunosuppression. We hope this will enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer.

To this end, we utilise cutting-edge molecular and cellular immunology, functional genomics, and mouse genetics and cancer models, and to enable the discovery and characterisation of novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms (see [Research](research)). We are located at the Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge and work closely with collaborators within both the University and broader Cambridge immunology community. Our science benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge.


 **We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master's students [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies)!**
