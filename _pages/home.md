## Welcome to the Roychoudhuri Lab

### Immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression

The last decade has seen an explosion in our understanding of the immunoregulatory mechanisms underpinning immune homeostasis and their dysregulation in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Breakthroughs in the field have resulted in powerful new therapies, including checkpoint inhibitor therapies that are now revolutionising the way we treat advanced cancer in a subset of patients. However, the work has only just begun. We believe that fundamental new discoveries in the field of immunoregulation will pave the way for new immune-based therapies for patients with presently incurable diseases.

#### Uncovering the ‘brakes’ on immune activation
T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive T cell activation. Immunoregulatory mechanisms also suppress beneficial anti-tumour T cell responses to drive deleterious immunosuppression in cancer. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ on immune activation and have important consequences in inflammation and cancer.

Our research aims to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning immunoregulation and cancer immunosuppression. We hope this will enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with autoimmunity and cancer.

To this end, we utilise cutting-edge molecular and cellular immunology, functional genomics, and mouse genetics and cancer models, and to enable the discovery and characterisation of novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms (see [Research](research)). We are located at the Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge and work closely with collaborators within both the University and broader Cambridge immunology community. Our science benefits from access to the world-class research facilities of the University of Cambridge.
