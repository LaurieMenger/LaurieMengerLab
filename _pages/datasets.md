<h4>GS-TCGA: Gene Set-based Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas</h4>
Created by Tarrion Baird in our lab, GS-TCGA is a resource designed to use gene set-based analyses to provide novel interpretation of the data contained in The Cancer Genome Atlas. It consists of four tools:

**Gene Set Survival Analysis:** GS-Surv allows the user to investigate how the average expression of genes in a specified gene set relates to overall survival in patient data.

**Co-Correlative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis:** CC-GSEA allows generation of novel hypotheses of gene function through performing GSEA on co-correlated genes.

**Gene Set Correlative Analysis:** GS-Corr calculates the average expression of a gene set and correlates this with individual genes.

**GS-Surv (Custom):** This function allows you to upload your own gene set for GS-Surv survival analysis.

**We are committed to providing public access to high-quality high-content datasets generated in the laboratory. Links below provide access to deposited high-throughput sequencing datasets generated by the laboratory through our primary and collaborative work.**
