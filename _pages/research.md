### Immunoregulation: Uncovering the 'brakes' on immune activation 
T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs suppressive mechanisms, referred to as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive immune activation. While immunoregulatory mechanisms play a beneficial role in preventing inflammation, they can also suppress immune responses during chronic infections and cancer in a process known as immunosuppression. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as 'brakes' on immune activation and are important therapeutic targets. 

Our research aims to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning host immunoregulation in infection, inflammation and cancer. We hope that this may enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with **inflammation** and **cancer**. To this end, we utilise molecular and cellular immunology, cutting-edge mouse genetics and tumour immunity models, and functional genomics to enable the discovery and characterisation of novel host immunoregulatory mechanisms.

### Transcriptional and epigenetic control of T cell lineage choice

T cells coordinate immune function by differentiating into highly specialised cellular lineages. Whereas effector T cells promote immune activation, regulatory T (Treg) cells, dependent upon the transcription factor Foxp3, suppress their function, preventing excessive autoimmune and allergic reactions. Treg cells therefore represent an important mechanism of peripheral tolerance and stability of Treg populations is required throughout life to prevent lethal inflammation. In cancer, however, regulatory T cells powerfully limit effector responses and their remarkable stability is a barrier to immune-mediated clearance of disease. The choice between effector and regulatory T cell lineage commitment is therefore among the most consequential decisions the immune system has to make. The transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) is required for Treg differentiation, but a broader network of TFs, including the transcriptional repressor BACH2, act early during Foxp3+ regulatory T cell differentiation to guide lineage choice and establish the full Treg cell transcriptional program. We are interested in the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that determine CD4+ T cell lineage choice.

### Molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumour immunosuppression

Growth of tumours in immunocompetent hosts is at odds with the powerful ability of the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The cancer immunoediting hypothesis has been proposed as a conceptual framework to account for this behaviour. According to this hypothesis, tumour development is characterized by an initial ‘elimination’ phase, during which a majority of cancer cells are destroyed by various components of the immune system. This is followed by an ‘equilibrium’ phase, during which pressure from the immune system contributes to selection of tumour variants that give rise to an ‘escape’ phase characterized by evasion from immune control and unrestrained tumour growth. While selection of antigen-loss variants represents a mechanism of tumour escape, it fails to explain why established tumours continue to express immunogenic epitopes that are recognized by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Growth of tumours containing immunogenic epitopes is better explained through an understanding of the critical role of immunosuppression in promoting tumour escape. Several projects in the laboratory aim to investigate the mechanisms by which immune function is suppressed within tumours. In particular, we are focussed on characterising microenvironmental factors and T cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immunosuppression, and adaptations by tumour cells to host immunity.
