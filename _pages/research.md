### Uncovering the 'brakes' on immune activation 

T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as **immunoregulatory mechanisms**, to restrain excessive T cell activation and prevent autoimmune and allergic **inflammation**. It is also now clear that immunoregulatory mechanisms suppress anti-tumour immunity to drive deleterious immunosuppression in **cancer**. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ on immune activation and have important consequences in inflammation and cancer. We believe that fundamental discovery in the field of immunoregulation will pave the way for new immune-based therapies for patients with presently incurable diseases.

A powerful example of the therapeutic significance of immunoregulatory mechanisms is provided by the clinical efficacy of cancer immunotherapies targeting the immune ‘checkpoints’ PD-1 and CTLA-4. These have revolutionised the treatment of patients with certain types of advanced cancer, including metastatic melanoma (Fig. 1). However, these therapies, which are thought to work primarily by affecting CD8+ T cells, are ineffective at inducing durable responses in a majority of patients and a majority of cancer types. There is a need to discover new and mechanistically distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms to drive advances in cancer and inflammatory disease immunotherapy**. A major aim of the fundamental immunology research in the laboratory is to uncover new immunoregulatory mechanisms whose dysregulation in tumours contributes to cancer immunosuppression. A second major aim of the research is to uncover immunoregulatory mechanisms that function to restrict autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The research aims to inform the development of new immune based therapies in the mid-term for patients with autoimmune and allergic inflammation and cancer.  

## Research themes
### Mechanisms of regulatory T (Treg) cell development and function

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are rare immune cells with powerful suppressive functions. Treg cells also suppress immune responses in cancer. There is intense medical interest in exploiting the powerful biological functions of Treg cells to treat patients with inflammatory diseases, transplantation and cancer. Treg cells develop from similar precursors to conventional CD4+ T cells in the thymus and periphery (Fig. 2). Loss of Treg cells results in lethal inflammation, while defects in their function are associated with autoimmunity and allergy.However, efforts to exploit Treg cells clinically have so far been disappointing. This project aims to better define the mechanisms that drive Treg development and function, to define better ways of exploiting or blocking the suppressive function of Treg cells in inflammation and cancer.

<figcaption><b>Figure 2.

Treg-mediated restraint of effector cell function is a critical immunoregulatory mechanism required to prevent lethal inflammation. Peripheral tolerance is also maintained by extrinsic immunoregulatory signals received by conventional T cells in tissues.

#### Research highlights
We have a longstanding interest in Treg biology. We demonstrated the non-redundant requirement for the transcription factor BACH2 in Treg development (Nature 2013). The findings provided a model of early Treg lineage commitment and explained why genetic polymorphisms at the human BACH2 locus are associated with autoimmune and allergic diseases. We established a now widely-accepted molecular model of how BACH2 functions in lymphocytes (Nat Immunol 2016; reviewed in Igarashi, Kurosaki and Roychoudhuri, Nat Rev Immunol 2017). Our research contributed to the discovery of a new human disease called BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (Afzali et al., Nat Immunol 2017). This has led to identification and improved management of patients with BRIDA. We showed that BACH2 promotes Treg-mediated cancer immunosuppression (J Clin Invest 2015). We have subsequently developed cell-based reporter assays for BACH2 function (Scientific Reports 2020), enabling a drug discovery programme in collaboration with Cancer Research UK Therapeutic Discover Laboratories.

Our group showed that a distal enhancer at the prominent human autoimmune/allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.5 restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-b docking receptor GARP on Treg cells, revealing a novel mechanism of immune regulation in the gut (Nature 2020).  We have shown that Treg differentiation is sensitive to local oxygen concentration contributing to lung immune homeostasis but creating a permissive environment for pulmonary cancer metastasis (Cell 2016). We showed that CCR8 expression marks Treg cells with highly suppressive function in tumours but that it is dispensable for their accumulation and suppressive function (Immunology 2021). 

### Mechanisms of T cell maintenance and memory
T cell responses clonally expand from small numbers of antigen-specific naive precursor cells. Antigen-specific T cell responses must be maintained over long periods of time to enable T cell memory and durable responses to chronic antigens. We aim to determine mechanisms that underpin long-lived T cell responses.

While conventional T cell memory has been the focus of our prior research, we have recently become interested in understanding how clonal Treg responses are maintained over long periods of time. To work properly, Treg responses need to be remarkably long-lived: Treg cells produced during a critical time-window in early life need to be maintained throughout life to prevent lethal inflammation. Treg populations are maintained despite reduced thymic output of T cells as we age, and in the definitive absence of thymic output. The transfer of mature Treg cells into Treg-deficient mice establishes a long-lived population that prevents lethal inflammation over the lifespan of the host. Maintenance of Treg responses is also critical to immunoregulatory memory, limiting harmful immune reactions upon re-exposure to allergens and infection, and to the efficacy of Treg cell therapies. Much is known about how Treg cells develop, but we have lacked a framework for understanding how Treg responses are maintained. Our recent work has begun to reshape our thinking about how Treg responses are organised. We have found that long-term maintenance of Treg populations is dependent upon the presence of a subset of functionally quiescent cells marked by high levels of Bach2 expression (**Fig. 3**; Grant, Yang et al., J Exp Med 2020). We are interested in examining whether durable clonal Treg responses requires the maintenance of quiescent stem-like progenitors and understanding the consequences of this for inflammatory and allergic diseases and cancer.

#### Research highlights
We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells revealing unappreciated heterogeneity in T responses to immunisation (PNAS 2011). We defined transcriptional programmes of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Vaccine 2015). We have resolved molecular mechanisms by which long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection are maintained (Nat Immunol 2016). We have contributed to work showing that inhibition of AKT signalling enables expansion of T cells with a long-lived memory phenotype which mediates superior anti-tumour immune responses upon transfer into tumour-bearing recipients (Cancer Res, 2015), and that memory T cell–driven differentiation of naive cells impairs adoptive immunotherapy (J Clin Invest, 2015)


### Molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumour immunosuppression 

Cancers adapt to their immune environment to evade attack. According to the cancer immunoediting hypothesis (**Fig. 4**), tumour development is characterized by an initial ‘elimination’ phase, during which a majority of cancer cells are destroyed by components of innate and adaptive immunity. This is followed by an ‘equilibrium’ phase, during which pressure from the immune system contributes to evolutionary selection of tumour escape variants that give rise to an ‘escape’ phase characterized by evasion from immune control and unrestrained tumour growth.

<figcaption><b>Figure 4. Phases of tumour development according to the cancer immunoediting hypothesis.</b> Tumour development is characterized by an initial ‘elimination’ phase, during which a majority of cancer cells are destroyed by a variety of components of the innate and adaptive immune systems, including CD8+ T cells and NK cells. This process results, referred to as immunoediting, results in an ‘equilibrium’ phase, during which pressure from the immune system contributes to selection of tumour variants that do not express antigens targeted by the adaptive immune system or have developed mechanisms to suppress immune function. This gives rise to the ‘escape’ phase characterized by recruitment and support of the differentiation and proliferation of immunosuppressive cell types including Treg cells, tumour-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, expression of inhibitory ligands and such as PD-L1 and production of immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-b resulting in evasion from immune control and unrestrained tumour growth.

While selection of antigen-loss variants represents a mechanism of tumour escape, growth of tumours containing immunogenic epitopes is better explained through an understanding of the critical role of immunosuppression in promoting tumour escape. To achieve this, cancer cells subvert the biochemical, metabolic and ionic environment of tumours to drive immune dysfunction. We are examining the adaptations tumours make to evade host immunity using directed tumour evolution and high-throughput sequencing based approaches to uncover new mechanisms of tumour immunosuppression. We are also utilising high-throughput functional genetics to identify novel immunoregulatory mechanisms operating within the tumour microenvironment. 

Our research in the field of tumour immunosuppression benefits from funding from the Medical Research Council and from extensive collaborations with the industrial sector, including with F-Star Biotechnology, CRUK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories and GSK.
