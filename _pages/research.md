# Immunoregulation: Uncovering the 'brakes' on immune activation CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

have a powerful ability to drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also promote deleterious autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, collectively referred to as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive immune activation.

While immunoregulatory mechanisms play a beneficial role in preventing inflammation, they can also powerfully suppress immune responses during chronic infections and cancer in a process referred to as immunosuppression. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as 'brakes' on immune activation and are important therapeutic targets.

Our research aims to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tolerance and immunosuppression in physiology, and during infection, inflammation and cancer. We hope that this will enable development of new therapies aimed at manipulating immune function in patients with inflammation and cancer.
