### Immunoregulation: Uncovering the 'brakes' on immune activation 

T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can also provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulatory mechanisms, to restrain excessive T cell activation. In cancer, however, immunoregulatory mechanisms can be co-opted by tumours to drive deleterious immunosuppression. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ on immune activation and have important consequences in inflammation and cancer.

#### Transcriptional and epigenetic control of Treg lineage specification and maintenance

T cells coordinate immune function by differentiating into highly specialised cellular lineages. Whereas effector T cells promote immune activation, regulatory T (Treg) cells, dependent upon the transcription factor Foxp3, suppress their function, preventing excessive autoimmune and allergic reactions. Treg cells therefore represent an important immunoregulatory mechanism underpinning peripheral tolerance and stability of Treg populations is required throughout life to prevent lethal inflammation. In cancer, however, regulatory T cells powerfully limit effector responses and their stability is a barrier to immune-mediated clearance of disease. We are interested in the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of Treg lineage specification. 

For example, we have shown that alternate lineage repression by the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is required to stabilise early Treg cell development with consequences for immune homeostasis (Nature 2013, Nature 2015) and tumour immunity (J Clin Invest 2016). We have shown that the PHD family of HIF transcription factor prolyl hydroxylases enable induced Treg differentiation to be modulated by extracellular oxygen concentrations and drive permissivity of the lung to tumour metastasis (Cell 2016). 
We are also interested in the signalling, transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that control Treg population dynamics and lineage stability within tumours, and the potential for cancer immunotherapies to affect these aspects of Treg biology.

#### Understanding the adaptions of tumours to their adaptive immune environment

Growth of tumours in immunocompetent hosts is at odds with the ability of the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The cancer immunoediting hypothesis provides a conceptual framework to account for this. According to this hypothesis, tumour development is characterized by an initial ‘elimination’ phase, during which a majority of cancer cells are destroyed by various components of the immune system. This is followed by an ‘equilibrium’ phase, during which pressure from the immune system contributes to selection of tumour variants that give rise to an ‘escape’ phase characterized by evasion from immune control and unrestrained tumour growth. While selection of antigen-loss variants represents a mechanism of tumour escape, it fails to explain why established tumours continue to express immunogenic epitopes that are recognized by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Growth of tumours containing immunogenic epitopes is better explained through an understanding of the critical role of immunosuppression in promoting tumour escape. We are interested in understanding the adaptations tumours make to evade host immunity, utilising high-throughput functional genetics and directed tumour evolution.
