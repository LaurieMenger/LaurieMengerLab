Firas gained an MSc in Biotechnology from Hanover Medical School (MHH) where he studied the molecular regulation of haematopoietic stem cell differentiation. Firas moved to the USA to continue this work as a research scholar at University of California in San Francisco (UCSF). At UCSF, Firas' research elucidated lineage-specific roles of key oncogenic proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).

Firas is now in Rahul Roychoudhuriâ€™s group at the Babraham Institute, investigating how long range enhancer-promoter interactions drive cell-fate decisions within the CD4+ T cell lineage to dictate the outcome of immune responses.
