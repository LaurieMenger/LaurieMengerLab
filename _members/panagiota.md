Panagiota graduated in 2017 from the Department of Biological Applications and Technology of the University of Ioannina/Northwest Greece after a five year course of study. Her diploma thesis explored the role of the ETS family transcription factor, ERF, in thymic T cell development. She has, also, done an internship in Athens at BRFAA in computational chemistry working with Free Energy Perturbation calculations for lead optimization of specific compounds. Panagiota was an Erasmus+ placement programme student and then a research assistant within the lab. Her work aims to develop new tools to measure the effect of transcription factors on gene expression control.
