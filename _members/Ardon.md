Ardon completed his pre-clinical medical training at the University of Cambridge, graduating top of his year with a BA in Pharmacology. During his undergraduate studies, he undertook a research project in the Pharmacology department, studying the mechanisms by which IL-6 sensitises nociceptors. 

He is on the Cambridge MB-PhD programme and is currently undertaking a PhD in the Roychoudhuri lab, studying the mechanisms by which the tumour interstitial environment suppresses CD8+ T cells. Ardon also teaches medical students at Magdalene College and Christ's College, teaching second year and third year pharmacology.
