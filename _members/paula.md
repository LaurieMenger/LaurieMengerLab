Paula joined Rahul's lab in April 2019 soon after receiving her PhD in the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. During her PhD, Paula studied studied immune responses against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) antigens in the context of long-term infection and during the pre-cancerous stage in cervical cancer development. Among other findings, her research identified the important role of CXCR3+ T cells in clearance of HPV infection. Paula's current research focusses on Treg cells, cancer immunotherapy and interactions with the gut microbiome. She is also collaborating with industrial partner F-Star, investigating mechanisms of action of novel bi-specific agonist antibodies in cancer immunotherapy.
