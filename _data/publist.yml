- title: "A monogenic inflammatory disease called BRIDA"
  image: afzali_NI_2017_b.png
  description: Here, we described for the first time a human monogenic disease resulting from inactivating mutations of BACH2, termed BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA). The work, resulted from an international collaboration with clinicians and scientists in the UK and the US.

- title: "BACH transcription factors in innate and adaptive immunity"
  image: igarashi_nri_2017_b.png
  description: A review on BACH family transcriptional repressors in innate and adaptive immunity. We highlight similarities at a molecular level in the cell-type-specific activities of the BACH factors, proposing that competitive interactions of BACH proteins with transcriptional activators of the bZIP family form a common mechanistic theme underlying their diverse actions.
