  image: Whiteside_immunology_ccr8_2021.png
  description: There is interest in developing therapies that selectively target the suppressive functions of Treg cells within tumours. We show that high levels of CCR8 expression distinguish highly suppressive Treg cells within tumours, but that genetic deletion of CCR8 has minimal impact on Treg suppressive function or tumor growth. These findings suggest that CCR8 is not required for Treg suppression within tumours and that depletion of CCR8+ Treg cells rather than blockade of CCR8 function is a promising approach for selective immunotherapy.

- title: "A distal enhancer at risk locus 11q13.5 promotes suppression of colitis by Treg cells"
  image: Nasrallah_Imianowski_Lrrc32_Nature.png
  description: Genetic variations underlying risk of complex immune-mediated diseases are concentrated within the non-coding genome at enhancers. The functions of a vast majority of enhancers are unresolved. Using CRISPR-based mutagenesis of human disease-associated enhancer homologs in mice, we show that a distal enhancer at the human 11q13.5 immune disease risk locus promotes Treg-mediated suppression of colitis by driving expression of the TGF-Î² docking receptor GARP on Treg cells.

- title: "BACH2 drives quiescence and maintenance of resting Treg cells to promote homeostasis and cancer immunosuppression"
  image: Grant_Yang_Bach2_JEM.png
  description: This study establishes a critical function of quiescent cells in Treg maintenance. The transcription factor BACH2 is critical for Treg cell development. We show that in mature Treg cells, the function of BACH2 is repurposed. Bach2 is highly expressed in a subset of Treg cells where it binds to enhancers of genes associated with Treg activation and represses their TCR- and AP-1-driven induction. By imposing quiescence in a subset of Treg cells, BACH2 promotes maintenance of Treg responses, and durable immune suppression in cancer.

- title: "A human monogenic inflammatory disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in BACH2"
  image: afzali_NI_2017_b.png
  description: This study describes a human monogenic disease resulting from inactivating mutations of BACH2, termed BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA). Affected patients have lymphocyte-differentiation defects associated with immunodeficiency and inflammation of the intestinal tract and lungs. This work was informed by our earlier fundamental studies and resulted from an international collaboration with clinical and academic researchers in the US and UK.

- title: "BACH transcription factors in innate and adaptive immunity"
  image: igarashi_nri_2017_b.png
  description: Here we review roles of BACH family transcriptional repressors in innate and adaptive immunity. We highlight similarities at a molecular level in the cell-type-specific activities of the BACH factors, proposing that competitive interactions of BACH proteins with transcriptional activators of the bZIP family form a common mechanistic theme underlying their diverse actions.

- title: "High levels of extracellular potassium in tumours suppress T cell activation"
  image: eil_nature_2016_b.png
  description: This study revealed that cell death in the tumour microenvironment releases intracellular potassium into the extracellular microenvironment of tumours, causing profound suppression of T cell activation. High extracellular potassium concentrations impair T cell receptor (TCR)-driven Akt-mTOR phosphorylation and effector programmes. Engineering CD8+ T cells to be resistant to high extracellular potassium in tumours improves adoptive immunotherapy.

  image: clever_cell_2016_a.png
  description: The lung is a frequent site of cancer metastasis. Here, we show that T cell responses to metastasis within the lung are restricted by high oxygen concentrations. The HIF prolyl hydroxylases PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 mediate sensitivity of T cells to oxygen, which suppresses Th1 responses and promotes iTreg responses within the lung. As a consequence, immunologic permissivity of the lung to cancer metastasis is dependent upon PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3.

- title: "BACH2 functions as an AP-1 repressor in lymphocytes to promote CD8+ T cell memory"
  image: roychoudhuri_ni_2016_a.png
  description: This study was the first to define BACH2 key regulator of lymphocyte quiescence and maintenance. We showed that BACH2 restrains effector differentiation and promote generation of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells after viral infection. We found that BACH2 binds to enhancers where it engages in steric competition with AP-1 factors, limiting TCR-driven induction of AP-1 target genes to promote memory formation.

  description: This study established a role of BACH2 in Treg-mediated tumour immunosuppression. This function is corroborated by results of a large in vivo screen of host restriction factors to tumour metastasis (Van der Weyden et al., Nature 2017) and provides a basis for a CRUK-funded drug development programme with CRUK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories to identify small molecule inhibitors of the suppressive activity of BACH2.

  image: Roychoudhuri_nature_2013_a.png
  description: This study established the critical function of the transcription factor BACH2 in immunological tolerance. We found that BACH2 is required for early Treg cell development and its deletion in mice results in lethal inflammation. The findings contributed to our understanding of why genetic polymorphisms within the BACH2 locus in humans are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and allergic diseases (reviewed in Igarashi, Kurosaki and Roychoudhuri, Nat Rev Immunol 2017).
